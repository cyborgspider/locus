      p The R&amp;D Tax Credit is an overlooked and misunderstood tax benefit that most taxpayers and many tax preparers associate only with technology, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Qualified activities no longer need to result in new technological knowledge; they only need to involve the use of technological principles to develop new or improved products, processes, software, etc. As a result, more companies than ever before can take advantage of these benefits.
      h2 Examples of qualifying activities:
      ul 
        li Developing or testing new products or materials 
        li Developing new or enhanced formulations 
        li Testing new concepts
        li Improving existing products
        li Trial and error experimentation
        li Design and analysis of prototypes or models
        li Developing or improving production or manufacturing processes
        li Developing, implementing or upgrading systems/software
        li Paying outside consultants/contractors to perform any of these activities
        li And more...
      p The R&amp;D Tax Credit is one of the most significant tax incentives available to taxpayers. The benefits of this credit are numerous:
      ul
        li The credit is generally equal to 13% of qualified costs and is a dollar for dollar match on both federal and state taxes owed.
        li Businesses can claim R&amp;D Tax Credits for all open tax years. For companies that are in a net operating loss (NOL) position, R&amp;D Tax Credits are potentially available for additional years.
        li Federal R&amp;D Tax Credits can be carried forward for 20 years. Certain state credits have no expiration and can be carried forward indefinitely.
        li Companies that claim the R&amp;D Tax Credit see immediate earnings-per-share (EPS) and overall effective tax rate benefits.
