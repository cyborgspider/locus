              h2 Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)
              p WOTC is a Federal tax credit available to employers who hire and retain veterans and individuals
                | from other target groups with significant barriers to employment. WOTC helps targeted workers move away
                | from economic dependency, while participating employers are able to reduce their income tax liability.
              h2.list Target population of WOTC:
              ul.list
                li Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients

                li Food stamp recipients
              h2 Benefits
              p The tax credit employers can claim depends on the target group of the individual hired, the wages paid to that
                | individual in the first year of employment, and the number of hours that individual worked. There is also a
                | maximum tax credit that can be earned. Employers generally can earn a tax credit equal to 25% or 40%
                | of a new employee's first-year wages, up to the maximum for the target group to which the employee belongs.

              h2 New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC)
              p New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) provides tax credits for new private sector investment in economically distressed
                | communities through certified Community Development Entities (CDEs). An organization wishing to receive awards
                | under the NMTC Program must be certified as a CDE by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of Department of Treasury.
              h2.list To qualify as a CDE, an organization must:
              ul.list
                li be a domestic corporation or partnership at the time of the certification application;
                li demonstrate a primary a mission of serving, or providing investment capital for, lowincome communities or low-income persons; and
                li maintain accountability to residents of low-income communities through representation on a governing board of or advisory board to the entity.
              h2.list Four types of activities by CDEs are possible when utilizing the NMTCs:
              ul.list
                li Making investment in or loans to qualifying businesses
                li Providing financial consulting to businesses and residents of low income communities
                li Making investments in or loans to other CDEs which then makes investments in, loans to, or provide financial consulting to qualifying businesses
                li Purchasing loans from CDEs
            .tab-content(data-tab='low-income')
              h2 Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
              p LIHTC was created by the United States Congress as a part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to promote the development of affordable rental housing for low-income individuals and families.
              p Federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects. Developers then sell these credits
                | to investors to raise capital (or equity) for their projects, which reduces the
                | debt that the developer would otherwise have to borrow. Because the debt is lower, a tax credit
                | property can in turn offer lower, more affordable rents.
              p Provided the property maintains compliance with the program requirements, investors receive a dollar-for-dollar credit
                | against their Federal tax liability each year over a period of 10 years.

              h2.list To be eligible for consideration under the LIHTC program, a proposed project must:
              ul.list
                li Be a residential rental property
                li Commit to one of two possible low-income occupancy threshold requirements
                li Restrict rents, including utility charges, in low-income units
                li Operate under the rent and income restrictions for 30 years or longer, pursuant to written agreements with the agency issuing the tax credits.

              h2 Investment Tax Credit
              p Investment Tax Credit is offered to commercial renewable energy projects based on total dollars spent on qualified

                | Geothermal, microturbines, and combined heat and power panels are eligible for 10%.

              p Investment tax credit is earned fully when a project in placed in service.
              h2 Production Tax Credit
              p(style="margin-bottom:0") Production Tax Credit is provided to renewable energy projects based on total amount of electricity produced. Qualifying energy sources include:
              ul.list-bullet

            .tab-content(data-tab='three-part')
              p Governor Brown signed SB 90 and AB 93 on July 11, 2013. These bills phase out California's 28 year-old Enterprise Zone. The program, which provides tax
                | credits to businesses in targeted areas if they purchase qualified equipment or hire qualified employees, will be replaced with Governor Brown's new three-part
                | economic development plan.
