          h2 Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)
          p WOTC is a Federal tax credit available to employers who hire and retain veterans and individuals
          | from other target groups with significant barriers to employment. WOTC helps targeted workers move away
          | from economic dependency, while participating employers are able to reduce their income tax liability.
          h2 Target population of WOTC:
          ul
            li Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients
            li Veterans
            li Ex-felons
            li Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients
            li High-risk youth
            li Vocational rehabilitation referrals
            li Youth Employment program participants
            li Food stamp recipients
          h2 Benefits
          p The tax credit employers can claim depends on the target group of the individual hired, the wages paid to that
            | individual in the first year of employment, and the number of hours that individual worked. There is also a
            | maximum tax credit that can be earned. Employers generally can earn a tax credit equal to 25% or 40%
            | of a new employee's first-year wages, up to the maximum for the target group to which the employee belongs.
        .tab-content(data-tab='new-markets')
          h2 New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC)
          p New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) provides tax credits for new private sector investment in economically distressed
          | communities through certified Community Development Entities (CDEs). An organization wishing to receive awards
          | under the NMTC Program must be certified as a CDE by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of Department of Treasury.
          h2 To qualify as a CDE, an organization must:
          ul
            li be a domestic corporation or partnership at the time of the certification application;
            li demonstrate a primary a mission of serving, or providing investment capital for, lowincome communities or low-income persons; and
            li maintain accountability to residents of low-income communities through representation on a governing board of or advisory board to the entity.
          h2 Four types of activities by CDEs are possible when utilizing the NMTCs:
          ul
            li Making investment in or loans to qualifying businesses
            li Providing financial consulting to businesses and residents of low income communities
            li Making investments in or loans to other CDEs which then makes investments in, loans to, or provide financial consulting to qualifying businesses
            li Purchasing loans from CDEs
        .tab-content(data-tab='low-income')
          h2 Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
          p LIHTC was created by the United States Congress as a part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to promote the development of affordable rental housing for low-income individuals and families.
          p Federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects. Developers then sell these credits
          | to investors to raise capital (or equity) for their projects, which reduces the
          | debt that the developer would otherwise have to borrow. Because the debt is lower, a tax credit
          | property can in turn offer lower, more affordable rents.
          p Provided the property maintains compliance with the program requirements, investors receive a dollar-for-dollar credit
          | against their Federal tax liability each year over a period of 10 years. To be eligible for consideration under the LIHTC program, a proposed project must:
          ul
            li Be a residential rental property
            li Commit to one of two possible low-income occupancy threshold requirements
            li Restrict rents, including utility charges, in low-income units
            li Operate under the rent and income restrictions for 30 years or longer, pursuant to written agreements with the agency issuing the tax credits.

          h2 Renewable Energy Tax Credit
          p Renewable Energy Tax Credit has two major components:
          | <strong>Investment Tax Credit (ITC)</strong>, <strong>and Production Tax Credit (PTC)</strong>.
          h2 Investment Tax Credit
          p Investment Tax Credit is offered to commercial renewable energy projects based on total dollars spent on qualified
          | and eligible property. The credit varies depending on the type of renewable energy project; solar, fuel cells and
          | small wind are eligible for credit of 30% of the cost of development, with no maximum credit limit.
          | Geothermal, microturbines, and combined heat and power panels are eligible for 10%.
          p Costs that are eligible for the credit:
          ul
            li Hard costs (panels, inverters, mounting, electrical wiring, etc.)
            li Direct and indirect costs (system integration, permits, city fees, etc.)
          p Investment tax credit is earned fully when a project in placed in service.
          h2 Production Tax Credit
          p Production Tax Credit is provided to renewable energy projects based on total amount of electricity produced. Qualifying energy sources include:
          ul
            li Wind
            li Closed-loop biomass
            li Open-loop biomass
            li Geothermal
            li Small irrigation hydro
            li Municipal solid waste
            li Qualified hydropower
          p Different qualified energy resources have different rate at which credit is awarded. Production tax credit is earned
          | over 10 years, beginning when the project is placed in service.
        .tab-content(data-tab='three-part')
          p Governor Brown signed SB 90 and AB 93 on July 11, 2013. These bills phase out California's 28 year-old Enterprise Zone. The program, which provides tax
          | credits to businesses in targeted areas if they purchase qualified equipment or hire qualified employees, will be replaced with Governor Brown's new three-part
          | economic development plan.
