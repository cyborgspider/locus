Qualified activities no longer need to result in new technological knowledge; they only need to involve the use of technological principles to develop new or improved products, processes, software, etc. As a result, more companies than ever before can take advantage of these benefits.</p><h2>Examples of qualifying activities:</h2><ul> <li>Developing or testing new products or materials </li><li>Developing new or enhanced formulations </li><li>Testing new concepts</li><li>Improving existing products</li><li>Trial and error experimentation</li><li>Design and analysis of prototypes or models</li><li>Developing or improving production or manufacturing processes</li><li>Developing, implementing or upgrading systems/software</li><li>Paying outside consultants/contractors to perform any of these activities</li><li>And more...</li></ul><p>The R&amp;D Tax Credit is one of the most significant tax incentives available to taxpayers.
