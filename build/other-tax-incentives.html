              <h2>Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)</h2>
              <p>
                WOTC is a Federal tax credit available to employers who hire and retain veterans and individuals
                from other target groups with significant barriers to employment. WOTC helps targeted workers move away
                from economic dependency, while participating employers are able to reduce their income tax liability.
              </p>
              <h2 class="list">Target population of WOTC:</h2>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients</li>
                <li>Veterans</li>
                <li>Ex-felons</li>
                <li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients</li>
                <li>High-risk youth</li>
                <li>Vocational rehabilitation referrals</li>
                <li>Youth Employment program participants</li>
                <li>Food stamp recipients</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Benefits</h2>
              <p>
                The tax credit employers can claim depends on the target group of the individual hired, the wages paid to that
                individual in the first year of employment, and the number of hours that individual worked. There is also a
                maximum tax credit that can be earned. Employers generally can earn a tax credit equal to 25% or 40%
                of a new employee's first-year wages, up to the maximum for the target group to which the employee belongs.

              <p>
                New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) provides tax credits for new private sector investment in economically distressed
                communities through certified Community Development Entities (CDEs). An organization wishing to receive awards
                under the NMTC Program must be certified as a CDE by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of Department of Treasury.
              </p>
              <h2 class="list">To qualify as a CDE, an organization must:</h2>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>be a domestic corporation or partnership at the time of the certification application;</li>
                <li>demonstrate a primary a mission of serving, or providing investment capital for, lowincome communities or low-income persons; and</li>

              <h2>Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)</h2>
              <p>LIHTC was created by the United States Congress as a part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to promote the development of affordable rental housing for low-income individuals and families.</p>
              <p>
                Federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects. Developers then sell these credits
                to investors to raise capital (or equity) for their projects, which reduces the
                debt that the developer would otherwise have to borrow. Because the debt is lower, a tax credit
                property can in turn offer lower, more affordable rents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Provided the property maintains compliance with the program requirements, investors receive a dollar-for-dollar credit
                against their Federal tax liability each year over a period of 10 years.
              </p>
              <h2 class="list">To be eligible for consideration under the LIHTC program, a proposed project must:</h2>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Be a residential rental property</li>
                <li>Commit to one of two possible low-income occupancy threshold requirements</li>
                <li>Restrict rents, including utility charges, in low-income units</li>
                <li>Operate under the rent and income restrictions for 30 years or longer, pursuant to written agreements with the agency issuing the tax credits.</li>

              <h2>Renewable Energy Tax Credit</h2>
              <p>
                Renewable Energy Tax Credit has two major components:
                <strong>Investment Tax Credit (ITC)</strong>, <strong>and Production Tax Credit (PTC)</strong>.
              </p>
              <h2>Investment Tax Credit</h2>
              <p>
                Investment Tax Credit is offered to commercial renewable energy projects based on total dollars spent on qualified
                and eligible property. The credit varies depending on the type of renewable energy project; solar, fuel cells and
                small wind are eligible for credit of 30% of the cost of development, with no maximum credit limit.
                Geothermal, microturbines, and combined heat and power panels are eligible for 10%.
              </p>
              <h2 class="list">Costs that are eligible for the credit:</h2>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Hard costs (panels, inverters, mounting, electrical wiring, etc.)</li>
                <li>Direct and indirect costs (system integration, permits, city fees, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Investment tax credit is earned fully when a project in placed in service.</p>
              <h2>Production Tax Credit</h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom:0">Production Tax Credit is provided to renewable energy projects based on total amount of electricity produced. Qualifying energy sources include:</p>
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Wind</li>
                <li>Closed-loop biomass</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                Different qualified energy resources have different rate at which credit is awarded. Production tax credit is earned
                over 10 years, beginning when the project is placed in service.

                <p>
                  A new hiring tax credit for Designated Census Tracts and Economic Development Areas will replace the
                  Enterprise Zone hiring tax credit. Full-time employees meeting one of the criteria listed below will be
                  eligible. The credit will be available for tax years 2014 through 2020 inclusive and must be claimed on a
                  timely-filed original return.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An employer must make a tentative credit reservation in a manner to be prescribed by FTB for each
                  qualified employee within thirty days of registering with EDD. Taxpayers must also provide annual data
                  regarding these employees to FTB by the corporate tax filing deadline for their respective tax years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a recapture provision, with exceptions, for employees terminated in the first 36 months of
                  employment. The hiring credit has a five year carry forward provision, and is generated for five years
                  from the date an employee is hired. Employees must still work at least half of a given taxable year
                  within qualified areas and their starting wage must now be at least 150% of minimum wage. A qualified
                  employee must be hired 2014 onward and work in a Former Enterprise Zone, or a qualified employee
                  must be hired after the employee's job-site becomes a Designated Census tract.

                  the business fails to achieve the objectives outlined in the agreement. The program is repealed in 2025.
