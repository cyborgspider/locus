Developers then sell these credits </p>to investors to raise capital (or equity) for their projects, which reduces the 
debt that the developer would otherwise have to borrow. Because the debt is lower, a tax credit 
property can in turn offer lower, more affordable rents.<p>Provided the property maintains compliance with the program requirements, investors receive a dollar-for-dollar credit</p>against their Federal tax liability each year over a period of 10 years. To be eligible for consideration under the LIHTC program, a proposed project must:<ul><li>Be a residential rental property</li><li>Commit to one of two possible low-income occupancy threshold requirements</li><li>Restrict rents, including utility charges, in low-income units</li><li>Operate under the rent and income restrictions for 30 years or longer, pursuant to written agreements with the agency issuing the tax credits.</li></ul></div><div data-tab="renewable" class="tab-content"><h2>Renewable Energy Tax Credit</h2><p>Renewable Energy Tax Credit has two major components: </p><strong>Investment Tax Credit (ITC)</strong>, <strong>and Production Tax Credit (PTC)</strong>.<h2>Investment Tax Credit</h2><p>Investment Tax Credit is offered to commercial renewable energy projects based on total dollars spent on qualified </p>and eligible property.
